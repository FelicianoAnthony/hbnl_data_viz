Sample Data Visualizations
======


> examples of converting raw data to visualizations.  Github doesn't support `D3.js` so `linked_bokeh.ipynb` can be viewed [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/FelicianoAnthony/hbnl_data_viz/blob/master/linked_bokeh.ipynb) (will take some time to load) otherwise the rest can be viewed in the notebook.
